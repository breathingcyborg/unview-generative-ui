# UnView: Generative UI

## LLM Generated - Personalized Focused Views

Eliminate redundant UI development, saving countless hours. LLMs create personalized, focused views.

**Proof of Concept:** Just a POC right now.

**Problem:** ERPs need tons of forms/tables, taking forever to build (longer than the API!). Most screens are barely used.

**Solution:** LLM-powered UIs. Users describe what they need, LLM builds it.

## Flow

1.  **Give LLM tools:** API endpoints (or MCP server). Demo uses fake data generated by llm on the fly.
2.  **User tells LLM what they want:** Describes the screen.
3.  **LLM creates UI:** Gets data, uses generic components for a custom, focused view.

## Why not AG-UI Protocol (with CopilotKit)?

UnView's a bit different:

*   **Generic Components:** Aiming for UI components the LLM can configure dynamically.

*   **Nesting for Layouts:** Designed for complex layouts using nested components - more flexible.

## Setup

1.  `.env` file (copy `example-env`, add OpenAI key).
2.  `npm install`
3.  `npm run dev`
